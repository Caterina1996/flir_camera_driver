Flycapture and spinnaker packages needed for the driver to work.
Downloaded on 6/09/2021.
They should be available in https://www.flir.es/products/spinnaker-sdk/
but in case that the packages are not maintained any more the driver should work with this packages.

This version of the driver works with USB 2.0
